# Hello World!

"Just buy that domain!"

"Am I finally going to finish that mobile app?"

"Will I ever launch something?"

Coding is fun, but launching is hard. And I often doubt myself. But I'm finally ready. First domain acquired, many more
to come. I can't wait to build.

## My motivation

Even though I am currently employed as a full time intern, I constantly feel like I'm not doing enough.
I am young and don't have a great amount of responsibilities. So why waste my time? There's so much learning to be done,
so many projects and opportunities.

After procrastinating for a long time, I finally got my own domain. I want to launch, experiment, and connect with other
developers in the space.

The goal is to grow products, learn about marketing, SEO and running a (small) business.

But having fun will always be the most important. Even if that means pivoting often and leaving some projects
unfinished. It's a journey!
